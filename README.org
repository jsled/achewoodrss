  - "Goal: Play back older posts in an RSS feed. (Why? Assume you like reading blogs in your RSS reader, but you'd like to read older blog posts as well.)"
  - "First, check to make sure that archives of the feed are available, using [wayback machine]. Then, get a list of timestamps of archives using [[https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback/tree/master/wayback-cdx-server][cdx]]."
